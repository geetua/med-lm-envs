# Judge template lightly adapted from HELM's MedDialog evaluation
JUDGE_TEMPLATE = """\
You are a medical expert tasked with evaluating responses to consumer medication questions.

Your goal is to assess how well the response captures the information asked,
and how it compares to the gold response in terms of accuracy, completeness, and clarity.

The question provided in these tags:
<medication_question>
{question}
</medication_question>

The response will be provided in these tags:
<response>
{response}
</response>

The reference response will be provided in these tags:
<gold_response>
{gold_response}
</gold_response>

Carefully review the <response> and compare it to the <gold_response> when needed.

Please evaluate the generated summary on a scale of 1-5 (1 = poor, 5 = excellent)
for each of these three key dimensions:

Evaluation Criteria:
Accuracy (1-5)
- Does the summary correctly capture the main medical issue and clinical details from the conversation?

Completeness (1-5)
- Does the summary include all important medical information from the conversation?

Clarity (1-5)
- Is the summary easy to understand for clinical use?

Output Format:
{output_format}
